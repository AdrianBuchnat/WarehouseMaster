# Warehouse Master 📦

A backend application built with **C# and ASP.NET Core** simulating core logic for warehouse and inventory management. 

### 🎯 The Goal
The primary focus of this project was to understand backend architecture, relational data management, and data querying techniques in the .NET ecosystem.

### ⚙️ Key Features & Learning Outcomes
* **API Routing & Controllers:** Structured the application using controllers to handle incoming requests and manage business logic for inventory entities.
* **Relational Database:** Designed and integrated a database to handle relationships (e.g., One-to-Many between Categories and Products).
* **Data Manipulation with LINQ:** Heavily utilized LINQ (Language Integrated Query) expressions to filter, sort, and transform data efficiently without relying on imperative loops.

### 🚀 Tech Stack
* **Language/Framework:** C#, ASP.NET Core
* **Core Concepts:** LINQ, REST-style architecture, Database Integration.
